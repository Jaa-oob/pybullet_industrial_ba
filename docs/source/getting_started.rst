There are two ways to get started with the library. The first is to use the newest source version from the repository.
The second is to use the latest release version from pip. The source version is the most up-to-date, but it is also the most unstable.
The release version is the most stable, but it is also the least up-to-date.
The release version is recommended for most users, but the source version is recommended for developers.
To learn how to use the library once you have it installed, see the section on "Using the Package" to the left.

========================================
The release version is the most stable version of the library. It is recommended for most users. To install the release version, run the following command:

::

    pip install pybullet_industrial


Getting started with the source version
=======================================
The source version is the most up-to-date version of the library. It is recommended for developers. To install the source version from the repository, run the following commands:

::

    git clone https://github.com/WBK-Robotics/pybullet_industrial
    cd pybullet_industrial
